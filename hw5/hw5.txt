    Tp <= ((work - span) / P) + span
            #complete steps     #incomplete steps

        Assuming span incomplete steps, as stated in the equation, that means that only the incomplete steps are completing strands that are part of the span.
        That means that the complete steps only need to complete the strands not part of the span giving you the relation (work - span)/P
