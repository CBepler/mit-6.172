    By starting the index at -2^16 instead of 0, you have doubled the range of possible index values that register rax can hold. If you started at 0 you would only have access
    to 0-2^16 completely wasting the fact that the register can hold from -2^16-2^16. This allows %rax to easily index arrays up to the size of 2^17 instead of just 2^16.

    AVX2 registers are 32 bytes long instead of 16 bytes long for SSE. So to make the AVX2 aligned I had to align the pointers to 32 bytes instead of 16 bytes.
