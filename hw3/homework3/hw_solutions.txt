6.    uint32 arrays (4 bytes)
    Inital Time: 1.620096 s
    Vectorized Time: 0.386919 s         vectorization width: 4 
    AVX2 Time: 0.286102 s               vectorization width: 8

    Unvectorized -> vectorized: 4.187x speed up
    default -> AVX2: 1.352x speed up

    AVX2 vector register bit width is twice as long
    SSE: vectorization width * width of uint32 = 4 * 4 = 16 byte registers
    AVX2: vectorization width * width of uint32 = 8 * 4 = 32 byte registers

7.
    Vector add operation in SSE: paddd (packed add of doubles(4 bytes))
    Vector add operation in AVX2: vpaddd (vector packed add of doubles(4 bytes))

    The SSE version does this complex series of shuffles and multiplies to come out to the shifted outcome. While the AVX2 version just does a straight forward approach of loading
    in the data and then shifting it by the amount B specifies and saving it into C. This happens because shifting by a variable amount is only supported in AVX2, so the SSE version
    has to do various tricks to mimic this behavior.
