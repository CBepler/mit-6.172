Write-ups:

1. Yes, there is possile false sharing if multiple hashes are on the same cache line;
2. The fair insert is introducing a deadlock, because it waits to get the new lock before releasing its old lock
3. We pack the value and size into a uint_64t and then modify lookup to use that
4. To make a deterministic hash table structure,  you could do a sorted linked list bins approach. You could also have stricter rules for what happens if the bin wanted 
is occupied. For example, the smaller value would take precedence and then the larger value would have to look further in the hashtable.
